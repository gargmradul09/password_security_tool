### **🛡️ Password Security & Leak Detection Tool**  
In an era where data breaches are becoming increasingly common, ensuring the security of your passwords is essential.
This tool is designed to help users analyze the strength of their passwords and check if they have been compromised in known breaches.
By integrating with the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API, it allows users to verify their passwords securely without exposing them.
The project is built using Flask for the backend and a web-based UI for ease of use, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience.
